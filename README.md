1. General purpose discord bot with great uptime.
2. It has general commands which are constantly used by the users in the servers.
3. Commands such as serverinfo and userinfo provide information at your fingers tips within a ms. 
4. It is a general purpose bot meaning it won't have any leveling and roleplaying commands in it.
5. This bot will be constantly updated to make it free of all known bugs over time and to keep it constant up. 
6. This bot doesn't have a website or a webpage, it will be coming soon.

Notes :-
1) For using the welcome-leave logs, there must be a channel named <code>welcome-bye</code> in the server. If the bots finds that channel, the command starts to work automatically.
2) For the reports command to work, there must be a channel named <code>reports</code> in the server. Also anyone can use this command. The usage is - <code>b!report [person] [reason]</code>.
3) The createchannel command can make any type of channel, whether it is text or the voice. Also you can use the bot to create channel categories. The usage is - <code>b!createchannel [name of the channel] [type]</code>.
4) The deletechannel command can delete any channel in the server. The usage is - <code>b!deletechannel [name/id]</code>. Also in the command, you will have to mention the channel name, instead of just writing out the name of the channel. Also you can use the <code>id</code> of the channel, in place of the name of the channel.
