<p>You can get detailed list of commands using the help command <code>b!help</code> while you can also visit the official web page of [Bisly](https://bisly.glitch.com) to view detailed list of all commands.</p>

<p>Bisly is a general purpose discord bot with commands ranging from general to moderation, and from fun to some cute animal commands. With over 30 commands, you won't regret using Bisly.</p>

Notes :-
>1) For using the welcome-leave logs, there must be a channel named <code>welcome-bye</code> in the server. If the bots finds that channel, the command starts to work automatically.
>2) For the reports command to work, there must be a channel named <code>reports</code> in the server. Also anyone can use this command. The usage is - <code>b!report [person] [reason]</code>.
>3) The createchannel command can make any type of channel, whether it is text or the voice. Also you can use the bot to create channel categories. The usage is - <code>b!createchannel [name of the channel] [type]</code>.
>4) The deletechannel command can delete any channel in the server. The usage is - <code>b!deletechannel [name/id]</code>. Also in the command, you will have to mention the channel name, instead of just writing out the name of the channel. Also you can use the <code>id</code> of the channel, in place of the name of the channel.
>5) For the ban and kick commands, you must provide a reason to make it work. Also note the <code>that report can be used by anyone in the server.</code>
